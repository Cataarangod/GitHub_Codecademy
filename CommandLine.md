# Command Line + some ADHD

Hi, my name is Cata and I'm kind of new like you 😊 or maybe i've been trying to learn stuff for 3 failed years.

I want to keep this things that may look so simple but hard to learn OR KEEP IN MY BRAIN, because I always get distracted;
Sometimes coding can seem like a monster 👾 but once you take enough courage it's an easy and enjoyable fight ⚔.

Sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

The command line is basically where you'll make money, hehe jk, or not...🤨 When you work with files and projects,
it can be cool to just use a couple clicks and drags, but when you get more into it you'll notice It's NOT the (cool) way.

# Serious Part

The command line is a text interface for our computer's OS (Operating System), We can use it to traverse and edit our filesystem,
through the command line you can create new files, edit the contents of those files, delete them aaaand lots of pro things we'll learn together.

On Mac and Linux we access the command line with Bash; Windows comes with a different buil-in command line, but Windows users can also download bash.
